# Stair Skating in Resident Evil REmake / HD Remaster

## What Is Stair Skating?

Stair skating is a speedrun technique in Resident Evil REmake and HD Remaster that allows approximately **1.5x faster movement on stairs**. It's an animation cancel that works by rapidly mashing the Run button while moving forward on stairs.

Stair skating allows for, at minimum, 1.5× faster movement on stairs by repeatedly cancelling the standard 'stair run' animation. The more the Run button input registers, the faster you go.

## How It Works (Basic inputs, works on all consoles)

The technique is fundamentally about **input frequency**, not angles or positioning:

1. **Hold "Up" on the D-pad** This only works with Tank controls. **IF YOU USE THE LEFT ANALOG STICK WITH "ALTERNATE" CONTROLS, THIS WILL NOT WORK.**
2. **Rapidly mash the Run button** while on a staircase. This is the Square button on a PlayStation pad, or the "X" button on an XBox pad by default.

This repeatedly re-starts the run animation and **cancels the slower stair-walk animation**, making you ascend or descend much faster than normal walking. The faster you mash, the faster you go.

It looks silly but saves significant time across a full run.

### Important detail regarding Alternate controls
When playing RE1 Remake, most casual players are unaware that **CHANGING THE CONTROL SCHEME FROM ORIGINAL TO ALTERNATE ONLY CHANGES THE MAPPING FOR THE LEFT ANALOG STICK.** **This means that the D-pad is ALWAYS mapped to Classic RE Tank Controls.**
Just play the game with Alternate controls and learn to switch between D-Pad or Stick depending on the camera angle.

## Right Analog Stick Spin Method (PC Only, easier on your hands)

Instead of holding "Up" on the D-Pad and mashing the "Run" button, you can remap every direction on the Right Analog Stick to the Run button instead. By doing this, you actuate the Run input more times per second than simply mashing the button.
This allows you to move up and down stairs even faster than the basic method.

**Right Stick Spin Method:**
- Use Steam Controller Mapping to map the Run input (X/Square) to all directions on the right stick
- Spin or circle the stick so it repeatedly hits Run
- Hold forward on the d-pad while spinning

These methods do the same thing mechanically—just generate repeated Run inputs more easily.

## Input Frequency

The target mash rate is around **10 Hz** (10 presses per second) for "good enough" results. Faster is better, but 10 Hz provides solid time saves without completely destroying your hands.

## Why does Stairskating work the way it does? (Also, common misconceptions about stairskating)

**Stairskating is NOT about:**
- Hitting stairs at a specific angle
- Preserving run velocity through trigger volumes
- Any kind of geometry or positioning exploit

It's purely about **rapidly canceling the stair-walk animation** by starting the "kick-off" frames of the "run" animation state over and over.

## Turbo Controller Discussion

There's ongoing debate in the community about whether turbo should be allowed for stair skating on the leaderboards.
The analog stick methods are considered a "less intense alternative" that's currently allowed, while pure turbo button presses remain controversial.

## Time Saves

Individual stair flights will save one second here and there, but the time adds up across a full run. Consistent stair skating throughout a run can save multiple minutes depending on category and route.

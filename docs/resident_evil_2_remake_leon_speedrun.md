# Resident Evil 2 Remake Speedrun Guide - Leon A

This guide covers Leon's A scenario (first run) route.

## Gas Station (Prologue)

### Splits
1. Meet First Zombie
2. Storage Room Key
3. Meet Claire/Leon

---

### Overview

The Gas Station is the prologue section of RE2 Remake. Both Leon and Claire start here before the routes diverge at RPD.

Your character stops at a seemingly abandoned gas station on the outskirts of Raccoon City. Noises from inside prompt you to investigate.

---

### Meet First Zombie

**Investigate the Store**

The gas station interior appears deserted. The door past the front counter is locked.

Turn left to find a man on the floor covered in blood. He points you to a door behind the cooler where the commotion is coming from. Once you enter the corridor, the door shuts behind you, forcing you toward the storage room.

A police officer inside the storage room meets a grisly end trying to stop an attacker. You must put down this creature.

**Combat**
- Leon starts with the Matilda Handgun
- Three headshots will down the zombie
- Important: Zombies can get back up unless you destroy the head completely

**Speedrun Note:** In speedruns, you can skip killing this zombie entirely. Just grab the key and run past - saves ammo and time.

---

### Storage Room Key

After downing (or passing) the zombie, step past the officer's body to find a passage behind a row of shelves leading to a desk.

On the wall covered in posters, you'll find a key. Inspect it in your inventory to identify it as the **Storage Room Key**.

**Speedrun Note:** Grab the key quickly without stopping. You don't need to inspect it - just having it in inventory is enough to use it.

---

### Meet Claire/Leon

**Escape From the Store**

Return to the locked door on the left. The zombie will likely get back up to attack.

**Options:**
- Shoot again to down it
- Run past before it fully stands (faster)

Use the Storage Room Key on the locked door to return to the main gas station area.

**New Threats:**
- The man by the coolers has turned
- Another zombie knocks over shelving near the front counter
- You need to detour around the back aisle

**Escape Route:**
- Either route can result in a zombie grab
- One headshot can stun zombies while you slip past
- Loop back toward the front door
- Watch for a zombie hiding behind more shelves near the exit

At the door, Leon and Claire have their intense first meeting before escaping to Raccoon City.

**Speedrun Note:** Optimal route is to hug the right wall, one quick shot to stun the center zombie, then sprint straight for the door. Don't stop moving.

---

### Prologue Summary

**Key Items:**
- Storage Room Key

**Enemies:**
- 3-4 zombies (all skippable)

**Time Save Tips:**
- Skip all combat - just run
- Don't inspect items

## Underground Facility - Leon

### Splits
1. Saved By Ada in Parking Garage
2. Meet Ben
3. Crank Handle
4. Breaks Ladder
5. Club Key
6. Start Birkin 1
7. Defeat Birkin 1
8. Enter Parking Garage

---

### Overview

After finding all three medallions to trigger a secret escape route from the Police Station, Leon leaves Marvin Branagh behind as he begins to explore a forgotten underground path that may lead to salvation.

---

### Saved By Ada in Parking Garage

Entering the Secret Room, the path behind you closes. You can't return to the Police Station until you find a missing T-Bar Handle for the red slot by the stairs.

**Room Contents:**
- Typewriter
- Item Box
- Gunpowder
- Shotgun Shells

Head down the Underground Stairs. Halfway down there's a path, but go to the bottom floor first to find:
- Grenade on the ground
- Locked door
- Locked Special Weapons Case (enticing but inaccessible now)

Return to the middle floor and head out onto the catwalk.

**Speedrun Note:** Grab the Grenade from the bottom - you'll need it for the boss. Quick item box management here if needed.

---

### Meet Ben

Continue down the long corridors on the catwalk. You'll hear scuffling sounds - something is nearby.

Eventually you'll overlook a large Machinery Room. Head right around the catwalk to push a cabinet out of the way - only to be ambushed by a strange mutated creature.

**Speedrun Note:** This ambush triggers the G-Adult boss fight. Be ready.

---

### Crank Handle

After surviving the initial encounter in the Machinery Room, you need to navigate the area and find the Crank Handle.

**Speedrun Note:** The Crank Handle is essential for progression. Grab it during or after the boss fight.

---

### Breaks Ladder

Someone triggers a ladder to drop down in the middle of the Machinery Room after you deal with the monster.

Before climbing up, collect remaining items in the room. Check the room where you were first ambushed for:
- Green Herb
- Gunpowder in one of the lockers

Head up to the next room and pull the lever to bring a catwalk into place, forming a bridge to the Operator's Room.

**Operator's Room:**
- Typewriter
- Item Box
- Hip Pouch in nearby locker

The ladder at the far end takes you back up to the Police Station's Parking Garage.

**Speedrun Note:** The Hip Pouch is a valuable pickup - extra inventory space helps late game.

---

### Club Key

Obtain the Club Key in the Parking Garage area.

**Key Item:** Club Key

**Uses:** Opens Club-locked doors back in RPD

**Speedrun Note:** The Club Key opens shortcuts for RPD2 section.

---

### Start Birkin 1

**Boss Fight: G-Adult (William Birkin Stage 1)**

This strange mutated man is struggling with his transformation, but that won't stop him from trying to bash your head in with his giant pipe.

**Strategy:**
1. Toss a quick grenade to stun him
2. Unload with your weapons - target his face
3. When a giant eye appears on his mutated arm, focus fire on that
4. When he starts chasing, run and gun through the narrow passageways
5. Watch for blindside attacks from other angles
6. Take a few shots, run, do a quick-turn, repeat

**Steam Phase:**
Eventually steam from the machines envelops the arena making it harder to see.

**Item Pickups During Fight:**
- Bottom left: Red Herb, Handgun Ammo
- Bottom right: Green Herb, Handgun Ammo
- Top area: Grenade, Handgun Ammo, Green Herb

After escaping into the mist, the monster will crash down from above trying to ambush you. Quickly do a 180 and run, then toss a grenade or flash grenade to stun him.

His human side will sometimes try to stop fighting and kneel down. The most vulnerable part is the giant bulging eye that occasionally appears.

**Speedrun Note:** Grenades are key. Two well-placed grenades plus focused fire on the eye ends this quickly. Don't waste ammo on body shots.

---

### Defeat Birkin 1

Deal enough damage to the eye to turn it red. The monster will back away and topple over the railing.

A ladder drops down in the middle of the room - someone triggered it (Ada).

**Post-Fight:**
- Collect all remaining items
- Take the ladder up out of the Machinery Room

**Speedrun Note:** Make sure you grabbed everything before climbing. This section doesn't have much backtracking opportunity.

---

### Enter Parking Garage

Climb the ladder out of the Machinery Room. The ladder at the far end of the Operator's Room takes you up to the Police Station's Parking Garage.

You've escaped the Underground Facility and now need to find a way out of the RPD for good.

**Speedrun Note:** This transitions you into the RPD Second Visit section. The real work begins now with Mr. X, dogs, and the search for the Parking Garage Key Card.

---

### Underground Facility Summary - Leon

**Key Items:**
- Crank Handle
- Club Key
- Hip Pouch

**Boss:**
- G-Adult (Birkin Stage 1)

- Two grenades + pistol/shotgun to the eye ends fight fast
- Don't forget the Hip Pouch in Operator's Room
- Skip unnecessary items - only grab what you need

**Next Section:** Parking Garage → RPD Second Visit

## RPD Second Visit - Leon

### Splits
1. Diamond Key
2. Boxed Electrical Part 1
3. Large Gear
4. Mechanical Jack Handle
5. Small Gear
6. Ring Bell Tower
7. Boxed Electrical Part 2
8. Parking Garage Key Card
9. Exit the RPD

---

### Overview

After defeating Birkin in the Underground Facility, the ladder brings you up to the Parking Garage. What seemed like a simple escape becomes much more complex when you meet Ada Wong and discover the exit gate requires a key card - currently held by a prisoner in the Jail.

---

### Diamond Key

**Parking Garage Introduction**

As you enter the dimly lit Parking Garage, distant howls can be heard and the ramp out is closed by a gate requiring a key card.

Before you can plan your next move, a Zombie Dog attacks - but you're saved by a mysterious "FBI Agent" named Ada Wong. She exits through a door at the far end.

**Jail Area:**
- Follow Ada through to the Jail entrance
- Grab Police Station Map B1 and Handgun Ammo
- Watch for zombie officer playing possum on the floor
- Don't get too close to cell bars - imprisoned zombies will grab you

**Meet Ben:**
Ben has the parking pass you need but won't give it up easily. Before negotiations can finish, a giant hand bursts through the wall and crushes his skull. Ada reappears with more info - you need to find a way to open his cell (electronically locked).

**Key Items:**
- Square Crank (on table near Ben's cell)
- Memo: Jail Power Panel File

The memo reveals you need two Power Panel Parts: one in the Generator Room, one in the Clock Tower.

**Getting the Diamond Key:**

Head to the Morgue (past the Kennels). There's a zombie by the door - deal with it. Check Autopsy Record No. 53477 about a dead body known to steal.

The **Diamond Key** is on a body in the second tray from the far left - but he'll wake up angry when you grab it.

Other Morgue items:
- Flash Grenade (far corner, opposite side)
- Red Herb

**Speedrun Note:** The Diamond Key opens the Firing Range weapons storage (Red Herb, Film: 3F Locker) and the Linen Closet (Portable Safe with Spare Key). Grab early to maximize efficiency.

---

### Boxed Electrical Part 1

**Generator Room**

Before heading to the Generator Room, detour to the Firing Range:
- Equipment Disposal Notice File
- Tin Storage Box with Car Key (inspect and find latch)

Return to Parking Garage, inspect Car Key for unlock button, pop the trunk of nearby patrol car to get **Gun Stock for Matilda** (enables 3-shot burst).

**Kennels:**
- Blue Herb outside door
- 3 caged dogs inside (many empty cages - bad sign)
- High-Grade Gunpowder in green bin

**Pro Tip:** Kill the 3 caged dogs NOW while they can't move. This reduces the number of dogs you'll fight later when they escape.

**Generator Room:**
- Green Herb (left of entrance)
- Gunpowder (right wall)
- **Boxed Electronic Part** on small table - open to reveal Power Panel Part 1

**Power Puzzle:** Four switches control voltage to two meters. Flip the two switches on the right to restore power.

**Dog Attack:** Restoring power triggers escaped Zombie Dogs:
- One jumps fence in middle of room
- Another bursts through grate (unless killed in Kennel earlier)
- More dogs will attack in Kennels and Parking Garage

Sprint through the Kennels back to Parking Garage. 3 more dogs now populate the garage.

**Speedrun Note:** If you killed the caged dogs earlier, you fight significantly fewer dogs during this escape. Worth the ammo investment.

---

### Large Gear

**Break Room**

Head up stairs to the East Hall and enter the Break Room (safe room).

**Items:**
- Typewriter, Item Box
- Blue Herb (table)
- High-Grade Gunpowder, Handgun Ammo (lockers)
- MAG Ammo (sink in back room)
- Mr. Raccoon Toy (behind bags at foot of bed)
- **Fuse** (on chair in back room)

**Opening the Shutters:**

Head to the hall where Elliot died. Three zombies are feasting on his legs in the tight corridor.

Deal with them (Flash Grenade helps), insert Fuse in the fuse box to open shutter. Grab Combat Knife from wall. Elliot's remaining half will greet you - sidestep and continue.

**Getting the Large Gear:**

Head to the 3F East Storage Room:
- Flash Grenade, Handgun Ammo in lockers on landing
- Mr. Raccoon Toy by Chief's Room stairs

In the Storage Room:
- Two zombies hiding among shelves
- Shotgun Shells near Heart Door
- **Large Gear** in middle of room
- Blue Herb nearby

**The gear takes lots of inventory space** - you may need to come back for it.

Exit to Balcony (Blue Herb), go down ladder - it breaks, dropping you on the other side of the helicopter crash.

**Speedrun Note:** The Large Gear is needed for the Clock Tower puzzle. Plan inventory around it or make a return trip.

---

### Mechanical Jack Handle

**Getting Past the Helicopter**

The burning wreckage blocks the path to Main Hall. Items nearby:
- Handgun Ammo (bench)
- Two Green Herbs (behind stairs to alley)

**Water Valve Puzzle:**
1. Find Valve Switch left of Boiler Room door
2. Two zombies burst out - kill them
3. Throw switch to redirect water

**Boiler Room:**
- Gunpowder (first room)
- Typewriter, Item Box (back room)
- **Club Key** (taped to board)

**SAVE HERE** - have healing items and ammo ready with Club Key.

Return to Roof, use valve to send water onto helicopter. Enter hall, grab Red Herb.

**MR. X APPEARS**

The Tyrant tosses the helicopter wreckage aside. He will now hunt you relentlessly throughout the Police Station.

**Mr. X Mechanics:**
- Cannot be killed, only stunned
- 8-10 headshots drops him to one knee (~30 seconds)
- Incredible damage per hit - getting grabbed often = death
- Won't enter certain safe rooms (Break Room, Dark-Room)
- Main Hall is NOT safe
- Listen for his footsteps to track him

**Speedrun Note:** Only stun Mr. X when absolutely necessary - ammo is precious. Sprint past when possible, use rooms to lose him.

**Club Key Doors:**

With Club Key, head to Observation Room (past Chief's Office):
- High Grade Gunpowder (locker outside)
- Gunpowder on dead officer
- Confiscation Report File (safe combo: L6, R2, L11)
- **Bejeweled Box** (on table)
- Handgun Ammo (Interrogation Room)

**Waiting Room Safe:** Use combo L6, R2, L11 for **Muzzle Brake** (Matilda upgrade).

**Records Room** (use Club Key):
- Gunpowder (near door)
- Grenade (near Heart Door)
- **Mechanical Jack Handle**

Be aware: West Hall now has a Licker, and Mr. X will find you in dead-end rooms.

**Speedrun Note:** The Jack Handle is critical for reaching the Clock Tower. Get it and get out quickly.

---

### Small Gear

**S.T.A.R.S. Office Detour (Optional but Recommended)**

If you have the Red Jewel:
1. Place in Bejeweled Box to get S.T.A.R.S. Badge
2. Inspect badge, press button to reveal USB Dongle Key
3. Go to S.T.A.R.S. Office, insert USB in computer
4. Use monitor to access Armory
5. Get **Lightning Hawk Magnum**

Also grab Letter to S.T.A.R.S. Members File (from Chris Redfield).

**Keep the USB Dongle Key** - it doesn't get a checkmark, meaning it's used again later.

**Library Puzzle:**

Clear zombies from Library first - you need time for this. Lose Mr. X before attempting.

1. Assemble the Jack Handle in the bookshelf mechanism
2. Pull it right
3. Pull far right bookshelf left
4. Pull one more bookshelf (left of jack) to the right
5. Creates platform of 3 bookshelves to reach 3F Main Hall

Climb ladder, cross to Main Hall 3F balcony. Green Herb by Clock Tower door. Deal with two zombies outside.

**Clock Tower:**

Mr. X won't follow you inside the Clock Tower.

- Repair Plan File (table on right)
- Gear Box on wall - place Large Gear to lower staircase
- **Pick up Large Gear again** - you're not done with it

Back hall: Large Gunpowder, Mr. Raccoon Toy on windowsill.

Upstairs at clock mechanism:
- Remove **Small Gear** from clockworks
- Replace with Large Gear (activates first half)

**Speedrun Note:** Remember to grab the Small Gear - it completes the Clock Tower puzzle.

---

### Ring Bell Tower

Head back downstairs and place Small Gear in the remaining Gear Box.

The Clock Tower activates and the bell swings wildly, knocking down a package containing the **Boxed Electronic Part** (Power Panel Part 2).

**Speedrun Note:** You now have both Power Panel Parts. Time to head back to the Jail.

---

### Boxed Electrical Part 2

**Collected during Ring Bell Tower split** - the Boxed Electronic Part contains Power Panel Part 2.

---

### Parking Garage Key Card

**Return to Jail**

Your map should be mostly blue by now (only Heart Key rooms remain locked - Claire only).

**Route Options:**
- Standard: Down Library to 1F Main Hall (stop at Item Box)
- Alternate: Clock Tower → East Storage Room → Roof (ladder broke) → Fire Exit → Break Room

Save at Break Room. Put both Power Panel Parts in inventory. Keep Magnum handy. Ditch unused key items.

**Parking Garage Dogs:**
3 zombie dogs now patrol the garage. Peek from doorway and snipe them with pistol shots, retreat behind door, repeat.

**Jail Power Puzzle:**

At the electronic panel by Ben's cell, place both Power Panel Parts. Solve wire puzzle:
- Connect two left inputs to single top-right output
- Key: Use blue T-shaped panel to combine two wires
- Route top input right then down into U
- Route bottom input up and right
- Blue T catches both on left/bottom, outputs right
- Feed up-left then right-across to output

**Items from Ben's Cell:**
- Ben's Memo File (names your pursuer)
- First Aid Spray (behind toilet)
- Interview Transcript File (Ben's body)
- **Parking Garage Key Card**

**Speedrun Note:** Puzzle solution is always the same - memorize it.

---

### Exit the RPD

**Final Escape**

With Key Card in hand, all other cells in the Jail open - hall full of zombies between you and exit.

A handle at corridor entrance opens a side gate leading to an alternate corridor... with the Tyrant waiting.

**Strategy:**
Choose the Tyrant corridor - if you fight through zombies, he shows up anyway in the middle of the melee.

1. Let zombies approach for a few paces
2. Dash into Tyrant corridor
3. Steady yourself, pull out Lightning Hawk
4. Headshot him as he closes distance
5. He staggers - sprint past

Two more zombies stumble out as you pass the first corridor. Lead them one direction, sprint the other, or use Grenade/sub-weapon.

**Ada's Save:**
Mr. X follows you into Parking Garage but Ada helps you survive.

Use Key Card to open gate and leave the Police Station forever.

**Speedrun Note:** One Magnum headshot staggers Mr. X long enough to sprint past. Don't waste more ammo than necessary.

**Next Section:** Sewers

---

## Sewers 1 - Leon

### Splits
1. Meet Kendo
2. Start Alligator Chase
3. Leon Shot By Annette (Ada Start)
4. Enter Elevator Room
5. Trapped in Incinerator
6. Finish Ada

---

### Overview

After escaping the Parking Garage with Ada's help, Leon accompanies her out onto the city streets. Their search for Annette Birkin leads them into the sewers, where Leon is shot and Ada must navigate alone using her EMF Visualizer gadget.

---

### Meet Kendo

**City Streets**

Leaving the Police Department behind, catch up with Ada. Grab a Green Herb on the right as you exit.

After Ada listens to Ben's interview, weave through abandoned cars on the street. The road ends at a construction pit, forcing a detour through Gun Shop Kendo.

**Gun Shop Items:**
- Grenade (left wall shelf)
- Long Barrel for W-870 Shotgun (nearby shelf) - mod it now
- Handgun Ammo (back left wall)

You'll encounter Kendo the owner in a tense standoff. After the scene, find Ada at a chain link fence. Follow her to the Sewer Entrance.

**Speedrun Note:** Grab the shotgun barrel - upgraded shotgun is valuable for upcoming fights.

---

### Start Alligator Chase

**Sewer Entrance**

Enter the sewers through twisting pipe tunnels. When you hear an explosion, check the dead end for Handgun Ammo behind bars before going right.

In the small tunnel, something large slithers past in the far passage. Enter the Safe Room to save and manage inventory - ditch Police Station items, grab ammo and health.

**Old Waterway:**
- Follow the long path with Ada
- Handgun Ammo on barrels by the stairs
- Another loud noise rocks the area
- Path ends at a drop into sewage tunnel

**SAVE BEFORE DROPPING DOWN**

**Giant Mutated Alligator Chase:**

Jump down and the Giant Alligator appears. Conventional weapons won't work - this is a rear-camera running sequence.

**Strategy:**
1. Stay in the middle to avoid debris
2. When gator lunges forward, veer hard to the side
3. Return to center between lunges
4. Zig-zag left and right to throw it off
5. Stay on sides during bite attempts

When sewage builds up on both sides, run straight until you dive down a slope. The alligator gets its jaws stuck on a flammable pipe - **quickly turn and shoot the pipe** to blow its head apart.

**Post-Chase Items:**
- Grenade (among the sewage)
- Mr. Raccoon Toy (southeast corner on low ledge behind debris)

Climb the ladder Ada drops, follow her to an elevator leading to the proper Sewer area.

**Speedrun Note:** Don't panic during the chase. Consistent middle running with side dodges during lunges is the safe strat. One shot to the pipe ends it.

---

### Leon Shot By Annette (Ada Start)

**Finding Annette**

The next room has a Typewriter but no Item Box. In the following room, you find Annette Birkin, but events unfold that leave Leon shot and out of commission.

**Playing as Ada Wong**

You now control Ada with only:
- Broom Hc Handgun
- Limited ammo
- EMF Visualizer (special gadget)

**EMF Visualizer:**
- Detects wiring that powers electronic machinery
- Hack yellow dots to control power flow
- Essential for progressing through this section

**First Fan Puzzle:**

Check the burnt zombie corpse (raises questions about what happened). Walk past Leon to a ladder with a closed fan vent.

1. Use Visualizer to find box on right of ladder - hack it to start fan
2. Look up at the fan - hack it to spin faster until it breaks
3. Climb through broken vent

**Second Fan Puzzle:**

In the large vent, another fan blocks the path with a zombie ready below.

1. Find box on bottom right to activate fan
2. Hack fan to blow it apart
3. Before dropping: use Visualizer to find power subsection left of fan
4. Hack to reroute power from fan to the door (red light → green light)

Drop down, grab Sept. Inspection (Week 1) File about ID Wristbands, then run for the door before the zombie reaches you.

**Speedrun Note:** Pre-hack the door before dropping to avoid dealing with the zombie entirely.

---

### Enter Elevator Room

**Lift Puzzle Area**

Grab Handgun Ammo at the end of the catwalk, then head down to the locked lift.

Follow the EMF Visualizer trail around the room. Watch for zombies:
- Left passage: one zombie (correct path)
- Right passage: zombie at dead end
- Further right: zombie slumped against wall

Stick to the left wall until you reach a balcony overlooking stairs. A zombie drops from above right next to you.

Point Visualizer past the unreachable staircase to find the junction box - hack it to power the lift.

Follow path to dead end opposite the lift:
- Handgun Ammo (crate)
- Flash Grenade

Return to lift quickly, using Flash Grenade if multiple zombies pursue. Take the lift up.

You'll see Annette escape through a secret door. Follow the catwalk to exit.

### Trapped in Incinerator

**Tyrant Encounter**

Entering the hall Annette left, Mr. X appears using the lift you just came up - he's followed you.

**Quick Escape:**
1. Run to the door at end of hall
2. Lever isn't powered - use Visualizer
3. Hack box on right to power the door
4. Get inside

**Fan Room:**
The room looks like a dead end. Fan vent at back needs power.

1. Look above the door you entered - hack to reroute power to fan
2. Hack fan to overload and break it
3. Use tables to keep distance from Tyrant while hacking
4. Handgun Ammo on table
5. Give him a couple headshots to drop him if you need time
6. Dive through broken fan to escape

**Incinerator Room**

Typewriter at top of stairs. Door to right is unpowered.

Use Visualizer to trace lines:
- One conduit goes to incinerator door
- Another goes up stairs to console

Go up stairs, find Sept. Inspection (Week 2) File, throw switch to open incinerator door.

Check right of incinerator door for Mr. Raccoon Toy.

Enter incinerator to find ID Wristband (Visitor) on a body at the far end.

**Incinerator Trap - 60 SECONDS**

Grabbing the wristband traps you inside as the incinerator ignites.

**Puzzle Solution:**
1. Hack junction box to right of the body
2. Look right - hack the box sending power to the first door panel (disables it)
3. Go back to conduit box, hack to send power up and over to opposite wall
4. Hack junction box sending power left to second door panel (disables it)
5. Hack wall box to send power right instead of left
6. Power loops to top of incinerator and central door panel - hack it
7. Door opens - escape!

**Speedrun Note:** This puzzle is always the same. Practice the order: right panel → reroute up → left panel → reroute right → center panel.

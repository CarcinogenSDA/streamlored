## Gas Station (Prologue)

### Splits
1. Meet First Zombie
2. Storage Room Key
3. Meet Claire/Leon

---

### Overview

The Gas Station is the prologue section of RE2 Remake. Both Leon and Claire start here before the routes diverge at RPD.

Your character stops at a seemingly abandoned gas station on the outskirts of Raccoon City. Noises from inside prompt you to investigate.

---

### Meet First Zombie

**Investigate the Store**

The gas station interior appears deserted. The door past the front counter is locked.

Turn left to find a man on the floor covered in blood. He points you to a door behind the cooler where the commotion is coming from. Once you enter the corridor, the door shuts behind you, forcing you toward the storage room.

A police officer inside the storage room meets a grisly end trying to stop an attacker. You must put down this creature.

**Combat**
- Leon starts with the Matilda Handgun
- Three headshots will down the zombie
- Important: Zombies can get back up unless you destroy the head completely

**Speedrun Note:** In speedruns, you can skip killing this zombie entirely. Just grab the key and run past - saves ammo and time.

---

### Storage Room Key

After downing (or passing) the zombie, step past the officer's body to find a passage behind a row of shelves leading to a desk.

On the wall covered in posters, you'll find a key. Inspect it in your inventory to identify it as the **Storage Room Key**.

**Speedrun Note:** Grab the key quickly without stopping. You don't need to inspect it - just having it in inventory is enough to use it.

---

### Meet Claire/Leon

**Escape From the Store**

Return to the locked door on the left. The zombie will likely get back up to attack.

**Options:**
- Shoot again to down it
- Run past before it fully stands (faster)

Use the Storage Room Key on the locked door to return to the main gas station area.

**New Threats:**
- The man by the coolers has turned
- Another zombie knocks over shelving near the front counter
- You need to detour around the back aisle

**Escape Route:**
- Either route can result in a zombie grab
- One headshot can stun zombies while you slip past
- Loop back toward the front door
- Watch for a zombie hiding behind more shelves near the exit

At the door, Leon and Claire have their intense first meeting before escaping to Raccoon City.

**Speedrun Note:** Optimal route is to hug the right wall, one quick shot to stun the center zombie, then sprint straight for the door. Don't stop moving.

---
